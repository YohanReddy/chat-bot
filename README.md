# Django Project

Welcome to my Django project! This project serves as an assignment task for an intern position at iGebra.

## Installation

Before running the app, you'll need to set up your environment:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YohanReddy/chat-bot
cd chat-bot
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Running the App

Once you've installed the requirements and set up your environment, you can run the app:

The application should now be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your web browser.
